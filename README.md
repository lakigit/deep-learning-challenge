# Background
Alphabet Soup, a non-profit foundation, is seeking a tool that can facilitate the selection of the most promising applicants for funding, thereby ensuring the highest probability of success in their ventures. The organization intends to utilize machine learning and neural networks in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier to achieve this. The classifier will be used to predict whether applicants will achieve success if funded by Alphabet Soup. The proposed analysis aims to optimize the process of selecting funding recipients through advanced computing methodologies.
